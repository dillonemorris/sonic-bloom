# Welcome to SonicBloom! 

SonicBloom is a music discovery app that generates personalized playlists based on user-selected "seed" tracks. By planting these seeds, you can watch your playlists blossom with recommended songs tailored to your unique musical taste.

### Purpose
The purpose of SonicBloom is to enhance your music discovery experience by allowing you to input your favorite tracks/artists and receive customized playlist recommendations. This app harnesses the power of [Spotify's Recommendations API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-recommendations). You select up to 5 track and/or artists that serve as "seeds" for the recommendations you receive. Those recommendations (tracks) are then the songs in the playlist you create.

### Usage
Unfortunately, due to Spotify's API restrictions, SonicBloom is not completely public. Spotify requires that users be added to a list before they can use the app. If you're interested in trying out SonicBloom, please let me know, and I'll be happy to add you to the access list.

### Contact

Happy listening!
